  6.2.  RTCDataChannel
    When an underlying data transport is to be announced (the other peer created a channel with
    negotiated unset or set to false), the user agent of the peer that did not initiate the
    creation process MUST queue a task to run the following steps:
      2. Let channel be a newly created RTCDataChannel object.
      7. Set channel's [[ReadyState]] slot to connecting.
      7. Fire a datachannel event named datachannel with channel at the RTCPeerConnection object.

  6.3.  RTCDataChannelEvent
    Firing a datachannel event named e with an RTCDataChannel channel means that an event with the
    name e, which does not bubble (except where otherwise stated) and is not cancelable (except
    where otherwise stated), and which uses the RTCDataChannelEvent interface with the channel
    attribute set to channel, MUST be created and dispatched at the given target.

    interface RTCDataChannelEvent : Event {
      readonly attribute RTCDataChannel channel;
    };

         value in configuration, [...]
